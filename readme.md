This is the iOS companion app for my bachelor thesis. Basically it's a mobile secure identity manager which also allows you to login into Windows, websites and Windows apps automatically and securely thanks to our proposed security scheme.

## How to open project
Just open SmartWorkspace.xcworkspace (due to CocoaPods)

## Note
Did not have time to reconstruct the folder hierarchy again due to a mistake when using git to backup a quite stable version onto GitHub.
The folder hierarchy should be similar to groups in project navigator or any thing you like.

The main purpose of folder hierarchy reconstruction is to easier to manage in Finder (or other file explorer), not related much to the groups in project navigator.

## Pods
The project used CocoaPods as depedency management. Libraries are listed in Podfile

Thanks !
